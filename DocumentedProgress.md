#Tasks Completed
-
##First video 
Video demo's how to get the environments set up - namely HERD (good to get projects set up and monitoring)
Also going to utilise visual studio code - feel most familiar with this.

## Second video
Checked out the filestructure
Brushed over the routes to begin with.
Route::get('/', function() {return view('welcome');});
This bit of code does the following.
1. declare a route
2. listens for a GET request, TO the root URL
3. runs a function if so, which returns a view called welcome
This view can be located in resources/views/welcome.blade.php

Blade is a laravel templating engine.
Cleaner syntax + additional features for dynamic web pages.
Roughly 5 mins into episode2 > Going to publish work to this repo. See yall soon.
