                        denyAsNotFound - This prevents unauthorized users from learning whether a resource exists.
                        Useful for multi-tenant apps, sensitive data, endpoints where access denied could leak information.
                        Clear policy intent - resource is not found for unauthorized users.
                        Shows as an authorization failure (403) in logs/monitoring.

                        denyWithStatus(404) - This simply returns a 404 status code. (GENERIC REJECTION)
                            This is not recognised as an authorization failure, treated like anuy other http error.

                        ✅ Made title dynamic - Uses $title prop or defaults to "Website"
                        ✅ Made heading dynamic - Uses $heading or falls back to $title
                        ✅ Added Vite assets - Includes your CSS/JS compilation
                        ✅ Fixed navigation links - Now uses Laravel route() helpers

                        Wanted to know what the purpose of aria-current was.
                        I could do the following: aria-current="{{ request()->routeIs('home') ? 'page' : '' }}">

                        First off- do not confuse this with laravel features. It's actually a HTML attribute used for accessibility.
                        aria-current indicates the current item within a set of related elements, like navigation links.

                        "It tells assisting technologies - this is the link representing the CURRENT page"
                            Sooo... that line of code checks if the requesst route matches 'home'. If it does, it sets aria-current to 'page', indicating this link is for the current page. If not, it sets it to an empty string.
                    
                        Example: a href="/dashboard" aria-current="page">Dashboard /a
                            This tells screen readers that "Dashboard" is the current page.

                        NOTE: not good to just return true or false. It's not a bool attribute.
                            Spec defined valid values like page, step, location, date, time, true (generic). false(means not current).

                        I'm aware you can prefix a prop name with a colon to help identify them as booleans instead of strings.

                        Simple mistake, but one I will remember
                        The response is that my current code contains array keys that look like this:
                            title => 'Web developer'
                        When it SHOULD look like this:
                            'title' => 'web developer'
                        
                        Simple mistake again.
                        Need to look into some sort of checking tool or change the colours because it can be hard to identify sometimes
                            On the lines of eslint? > Remember using this for react related stuff.

                        WHY THIS ISSUE AROSE.
                            PHP thinks title is a constant,
                                since you havent defined a title constant, it throws an exception
                            With quotes, PHP knows this is a string key

                            what post does it belong on!
                        
                        Other tables will reference the users
                        NOT the other way around.
                            You dont typically want to see ALL the comments a user will make for EVERY post...

                        So main outlook:
                            "ask yourself, does this entity belong to another entity?"
                                if yes: add a FK

                        Self note: maybe think maths?
                            The set of irrational numbers CONTAINS an element which may be irrational.
                                so that specific element BELONGS to the irrational set.
                        I think I'm complicating this further but the idea is there.

                        OUTLINE:
                            FK always always always goes on the CHILD that belongs to the parent.

                        Albanian aunties will always ask - who do you belong to.
                            your FK here is your fathers... birth certificate number, or something. ha! ha. ha :/

                        what is the meaning of orphaned records? 
                        When working with pivot tables and you delete an entity that is also an existing FK within the pivot table.

                        I'm being dumb perhaps.
                        It's just a named assigned to a record with no valid parent key (Remember that you only assign FK's to the children)
                            So orphan is a fitting name here.

                        My educational guess is that this is very dangerous for the following reason.
                            If a user - who makes a hot-topic morally incorrect post, happens to get removed from the platform
                            And their post remains, containing a FK to a userID
                            Then another user comes by filling in that ID from poor managed code
                            That post now appears under their name... Not good.

                        Found this online as "data integity holes"

                        Other pointers from gpt:
                        Orphaned records can:
                            Break queries that join tables
                            Cause inconsistent application logic
                            Lead to errors when enforcing constraints

                        I must have got this rollback thing wrong, or missed something.. but no code changed so idk.
                            But still. This fixed the issue, now table plus knows some pivot table attributes ARE FK's
                            Maybe it was because i did the sql query before doing a rollback migration + migrate?

                        Can i create another laravel project that sits in the directory of an existing laravel project without messing anything up ?? 
                        considered as two seperate projects.. just wanted to have two in the same place for github

                        Additional info: sidenote for episode 20 (laracast)

                            SIDENOTE: Not sure if I can just create a new project inside of this one or not... will it mess up with other configuration files?
                            Maybe if it was in its own folder...
                            Still, will it mess everything up..?

                        short ans: it can be done but dont. Make a seperate repo for this.
                        Problems can occur

                            This causes problems because:
                            Composer autoload paths get mixed
                            Git ignores things you might need
                            PHP namespace resolution might conflict
                            Artisan commands may detect the wrong bootstrap files
                            Web server could accidentally route requests to the wrong app
                            Storage/logs/seeding paths overlap
                            Deployment tools become confused
